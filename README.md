In my first year I had several assignments throughout my Programming 1 module, this being the first. This was completed on 31/10/2020. The requirements for this assignment were:

Write a Python code to ask a user to enter students' information including name, last name and student ID number. The program should continue prompting the user to enter information until the user enters zero.
Then the program enters search mode. In this mode, the user can enter a student ID number to retrieve the corresponding student's information. If the user enters zero, the program stops. (Hint: consider using list of lists).

This was my first ever project in Python and looking back, there are a few issues with this code. The worst flaw is that any student IDs with a 0 would not be registered by the program as a student ID â€“ instead it would just see the 0 and move to the next section / end the program. If I was to make this program now, I would also experiment with ways to make the data storage more efficient.
